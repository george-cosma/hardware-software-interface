# GCD - Greatest Common Divisor

Open `gcd.asm` and run the program.
The code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers given as parameters using the `eax` and `edx` registers, and then stores the calculated value back in the `eax` register.

1. Make the necessary modifications so that the error message - `Segmentation fault (core dumped)` - no longer appears.
1. Within the `print` label, display the result in the following format:

```c
gcd(49,28)=7
```
